					The thought of financial independence is an attractive prospect for any recent graduate. I've observed over the last six months, that many advertisers are using cryptocurrenices to push similar promises. Particulary to those people with a bitcoin related term in their cookie history.<br>
					In my case, I was hit with these adverts long after I‚Äôd initially invested. I mined four Ethereum when the price was around ¬£10/ETH. Back then cryptocurrencies weren‚Äôt the most popular place to put your money. Mainly due to the negative media coverage spawning from black swan events that affected Bitcoin a few years prior.<br><br>
					I‚Äôd been developing with Ethereum both independently and professionally before making the investment. In retrospect, my small investment in Ethereum was a by-product of understanding the platform's potential. I had a quite confidence that it would continue to grow.<br> In this post you should get an understanding of how to <i>recover a Jaxx wallet's credentials</i> if you've forgot/lost them.<br><br>

					<a class="link" href="https://etherchain.org/account/0x9393c36b0869f70c89d99be4b2a77f9fef710d59" target="_blank">My Dormant Ethereum Address</a><br>
					Any pay-outs from my mining hardware were sent to the account displayed in the above link. This account was managed through a <a class="link" href="https://jaxx.io/" target="_blank">Jaxx</a> wallet and backed up by a 12-word seed phrase. The first piece of advice you receive from Jaxx is to store your 12-words securely and don‚Äôt lose them or you‚Äôll lose your funds. Now, notice how I haven‚Äôt created any outgoing transactions from this account? Well‚Ä¶<br><br>

					Cutting a long story short, I unknowingly saved my 12-word phrase in a place that I inevitably wouldn‚Äôt have access to. More specifically, in an old work laptop that had to be returned. <br>
					Since then, I‚Äôve exhausted every possible avenue that's presented some a reasonable probability of success. Additionally, I‚Äôve also attended enough cryptography classes to know that the probability of deriving the private key by brute force, is just too low to even consider. üëé<br>
					Now you can see why these twelve words are quite expensive; considering today‚Äôs price of Ethereum, they total around <i>¬£1,000</i>. <br><br>
					The moral of the story is to take security into your own hands when entering the cryptocurrency domain. By design, there is no ‚Äòreset password‚Äô links provided by these protocols. If you want to be in total control of your funds, without trusting an intermediary, then make sure you‚Äôve taken the correct measures to avoid the situation above.<br><br>

					Let‚Äôs say you find yourself in a similar situation, where you've lost your Jaxx backup phrase. The only difference is that you‚Äôve still got the machine that physically stores the bits that make up your 12-words (e.g. Laptop with the Jaxx chrome browser extension). 
					Inspired by an article on <a class="link" href="https://vxlabs.com/2017/06/10/extracting-the-jaxx-12-word-wallet-backup-phrase/" target="_blank">vxlabs</a>, which highlights a vulnerability in Jaxx; I was able to recover my current backup phrase, without having direct access to it via the wallet GUI i.e. didn't know Jaxx pin code.<br><br>

					In short, this is how:<br><br>

					For this tutorial, I created an empty Jaxx wallet to keep my own seed phrase a secret. I'm using MacOS with a Jaxx Blockchain Wallet (Verson  1.3.4.5) installed as a Google Chrome (Version 61.0.3163.100) extension.
					<br><br>

					<div class="col-lg-12 text-center">
						<img align="middle" alt="Jaxx Blockchain Wallet Extension" height="120" id="jaxx_wallet" src="../images/jaxx_wallet.png" width="500"><br>
						<br>
					</div>

					After downloading and creating your pin protected Jaxx wallet, take note of your 12-word backup phrase. You‚Äôll need this to see if you‚Äôve successfully extracted the phrase from your filesystem at the end of the tutorial. The phrase that was generated for me was, <i>‚Äòghost marble error capable seminar around multiply owner click amused prevent fee‚Äô</i>. We will want to extract the exact same mnemonic/phrase to prove that you can bypass the wallets pin code.
					<br><br>
					To start, navigate to Chromes Local Storage folder. On MacOS Sierra it is, ‚Äò/Users/[username]/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Local\ Storage/‚Äô. This folder holds user data for various extensions installed within Chrome. The folder will be named similar to ‚Äúchrome-extension_ancbofgphhmhcchnaognahmjfajaecmo_0.localstorage‚Äù. You can open this folder with sqlite3, which can be downloaded here. 
					<br><br>
					<p class="code">
						brew cask install db-browser-for-sqlite
					</p>
					<br><br>
					Once sqlite3 has successfully opened the file, run the following command over the storage:<br>
					<p class="code">
						select value from ItemTable where key="mnemonic";
					</p>
					<br>
					This should return a long string which is the encrypted 12-word phrase. If you can‚Äôt find the Local Storage folder or are having trouble retrieving the mnemonic, you can install the <a class="link" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/storage-area-explorer/ocfjjjjhkpapocigimmppepjgfdecjkb?hl=en" target="_blank">Storage Area Explorer</a> extension in Google Chrome. Right click on the Jaxx wallet and select ‚ÄúInspect Pop-up‚Äù. Navigate to the ‚ÄúStorage Explorer‚Äù tab and choose window.localStorage. You can copy the mnemonic from the array of data there. Alternatively you can simply type, <span class="code">window.localStorage.mnemonic</span> in the Chrome console.
					<br><br>

					<p class="code">
						> window.localStorage.mnemonic <br>
						> fotQ+ffgUXP59/qBVR6h5pXFw61NMUopq6rkXI6DrMw22Bu60P3VfTceDkDBpaO0yffFiUqdgcWDHHmUFMoPy9Fj1DDgCYwjZcD1pL/HA06dx9+qAkYd4Gk4K60//HGf
					</p>
					<br><br>
					Note down the returned value for the next step. Using the following code, we will substitute our value from above into the mnemonicEncrypted value. Before executing this script, ensure you have Node.js and Crypto-js installed: <span class="code">npm install crypto-js@3.1.2</span>.
					<br><br>
					Save the file below as <i>generateSeedPhrase.js</i> and then execute it in the Node.js runtime.

					To run it refer to image below. Note that we've retrieved the 12-word phrase which will give us access to the Jaxx wallet, <i>'ghost marble error capable seminar around multiply owner click amused prevent fee'</i>.
